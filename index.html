					<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Typically most people find it comfortable to derive and think mathematics while writing either on paper or on a white-board. To be able to communicate these mathematical ideas with other people, it is beneficial to typeset it using standard tools like LaTex. However, transferring the content into this format can be cumbersome and need considerable human effort and time.</p>
					
					<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Hence, we propose to build an automated system that converts the mathematical equations in an image into LaTex using the techniques of computer vision and machine learning for pattern recognition</p>
